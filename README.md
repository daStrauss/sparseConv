The routines developed here in the sparseConv repository are designed to 
implement a method for pursuing 1-norm minimization in problems where the matrix-vector 
multiplication can be described as convolution. Development on this particular repository 
began in December 2012 and was initally parallelized using the classic MPI 
([message passing interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface)) 
protocols as adapted in [mpi4py](http://mpi4py.scipy.org/docs/usrman/index.html).
